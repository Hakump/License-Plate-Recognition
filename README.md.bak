# Domain Adaptation Methods - CCSA
CCSA is a combination of classification and contrastive semantic alignment loss

The approach of this method is aligning the distribution of source and target data distribution.
The training process generates weights making the distance of data with same label small and different label large.
In our scenario, the source and target refer to images in major and minor domains.

Given both source and target have labels, CCSA is a supervised learning method.

Function g and h denotes encoder and classifier, the distribution of data is computed with the encoded feature space of each image

To deal with limited target data, we compute the average pairwise distance between each data in source and target instead of their distributions.
The final loss function:
